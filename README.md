## Introduction

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The data was downloaded from this link [Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) on 30-August-2020  

*Note* : The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.  

Basically this assignment is about exploring the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. 

### Major questions to adress

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?  

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  

### Reporting Document Layout

* Title: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis  
* Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most **10 complete sentences.**  
* Include **Data Processing** section Which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis.    
* Include **Results** section  in which your results are presented.  


### Submission
For this assignment you will need to publish your analysis on RPubs.com.
